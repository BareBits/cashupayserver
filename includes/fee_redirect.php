/**
 * CashuPayServer — Fee-Redirect Module
 *
 * Decides, at invoice-creation time, whether an invoice's payment should be
 * pointed straight at a fee destination (dev / upstream / hosting) instead of
 * the merchant, and builds the rail destinations when it should.
 *
 * Why: fees are normally accrued and later melted out of the merchant's cashu
 * wallet by the cron (see DevFee::settleStore). That path is kept. This module
 * adds an opportunistic shortcut — when a fee is already owed in an amount at
 * least as large as the incoming invoice, the whole invoice payment is routed
 * to that fee's payee. The merchant gives up this one payment but their fee
 * debt drops by the same amount, so it nets out (the existing cron path would
 * otherwise have melted the equivalent from their wallet).
 *
 * Rules (locked in with the operator):
 *   - GATE (no overpay): a fee is only a candidate when its owed amount is
 *     >= the invoice amount in sats. The customer pays exactly one rail in
 *     full, so a fee can only claim a rail if it is owed at least that much.
 *   - PRECEDENCE: a single fee (the LARGEST owed that can cover at least one
 *     offered rail) claims every rail it natively covers on this invoice.
 *   - PER-RAIL (no all-rails requirement): the chosen fee routes the rails it
 *     covers (a LUD-21 Lightning address for the lightning rail, a
 *     network-matched xpub for the on-chain rail) to the fee payee; any
 *     offered rail it cannot cover falls through to the MERCHANT on the same
 *     invoice. So an invoice can be mixed — e.g. lightning -> dev fee,
 *     on-chain -> merchant. Whichever rail the customer actually pays decides
 *     whether this settlement is a fee payment or a merchant payment
 *     (see Invoice::railIsFeeRouted). We never disable a payment type.
 *   - Upstream, dev and hosting all participate. Upstream/dev destinations are
 *     global config; hosting's are per-store. A fee with no destination for a
 *     given rail simply can't cover that rail (that rail goes to the merchant).
 *   - We never split rails across DIFFERENT fee payees on one invoice; a
 *     single fee owns whichever rails it covers, the merchant owns the rest.
 *
 * The lightning rail reuses {@see LnUrlReceive::probeAndFetchInvoice}, which
 * requires a LUD-21 `verify` URL — without it we couldn't detect settlement
 * (we don't run an LN node), exactly as the existing lnaddress receive rail.
