/**
 * CashuPayServer — Free trial gate.
 *
 * Suppresses the upstream dev fee, dev fee, and per-store hosting fee while
 * an operator-configured free-trial window is open. Network fees (Lightning
 * routing / mint fees) are never suppressed — they leave the deployment as
 * actual sats spent on melts.
 *
 * Settings are seeded once from env at first migration (see
 * includes/database.php) and are NOT editable from the admin UI. Two
 * thresholds may be set; the trial expires when whichever fires first (OR):
 *   - free_trial_until_ts (int unix seconds)
 *   - free_trial_revenue_cap_sats (int sats, evaluated deployment-wide)
 *
 * On expiry, expireIfNeeded() advances fee_tracking_start_at to the moment
 * the trial ended so future fee math only sees revenue accrued post-trial.
 * Revenue earned during the trial is permanently excluded from fee bases —
 * matching the spirit of "free trial" (no retroactive billing).
