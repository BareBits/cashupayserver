/**
 * CashuPayServer — Stuck Funds detection.
 *
 * "Stuck" means: the store has UNSPENT balance in a mint AND that mint has at
 * least one withdrawal failure on record since its last successful melt (i.e.
 * the reliability tracker has it gated by `disabled_pending_success`, or has
 * already escalated it to `permanently_disabled`). Counted on a live read of
 * the reliability flags and the local proof store, so funds that become
 * unstuck (mint recovers + a melt succeeds, or balance drains to zero)
 * automatically stop contributing on the next call.
 *
 * The point of this module is to feed {@see DevFee::computeOwed}: stuck
 * sats are subtracted from the dev-fee bucket first, then upstream, then
 * hosting, so loss from a misbehaving mint comes out of the operator/dev
 * share rather than the merchant's settlement.
 *
 * Detection is intentionally per-store: the reliability row is global per
 * mint_url, but a mint only counts as stuck *for a given store* if that
 * store actually holds UNSPENT balance in it. A reliability row with no
 * balance behind it costs the operator nothing.
 *
 * Trusted-list-disabled mints are NOT treated as stuck: that flag is a
 * policy decision, not a withdrawal-failure signal. Funds in a trusted-list
 * mint are still meltable, just gated for new invoices.
