"""End-to-end: offline NWC/noffer wallets must not wedge invoice creation.

A store's destination chain is a noffer + an NWC connection, both pointing at
a live in-rig Nostr relay with *nobody behind it* — the relay accepts the
subscription and the published request but no wallet/service ever answers.
That is exactly the "merchant's wallet is offline" failure mode: the relay
(public infrastructure) is up, the wallet is not.

Invoice creation walks the chain server-side, so the customer's checkout
request blocks while each dead destination times out. With the enforced
per-destination checkout budget (5s each by default) the whole walk must stay
bounded and fall back to the mint rail; before the budgets were enforced this
took 20s+ (10s per destination, with socket reads able to overrun further).

The destinations are inserted straight into sqlite because the admin save
path probes NWC connections at save time and would (correctly) refuse a dead
wallet — the scenario here is a wallet that was healthy at save time and went
offline later.

PHP-side counterparts: tests/php/test_destination_timeout_budget.php and
tests/php/test_invoice_direct_receive_timeout.php.
