 * Regression test for the WordPress-alongside dashboard 404 on
 * PATH_INFO-hostile hosts (Local WP's stock nginx, most managed nginx).
 *
 * admin.php used to 302 every bare request to <base>/admin.php/dashboard —
 * a path-style URL such hosts cannot serve: it falls through the web server
 * into the surrounding site's themed 404, so the operator could never reach
 * the admin at all (the wp-admin dashboard iframe, the SSO handoff, and
 * every direct visit all funnel through that redirect).
 *
 * Urls::adminUsesPathUrls() is the pure decision admin.php now routes on:
 * path-style view URLs only where the host PROVABLY routes them — clean mode
 * (the wizard's probe verified the front controller) or a request that
 * itself arrived carrying a PATH_INFO tail — and query-style
 * (admin.php?view=…) everywhere else.
