/**
 * Regression: the shipped .htaccess must declare a DirectoryIndex that serves
 * index.php.
 *
 * Why this matters: on a subdirectory install (e.g. https://mysite.com/cashupay)
 * loading the bare directory URL must run index.php, which redirects a
 * not-yet-configured install into the setup wizard. Apache only runs index.php
 * for a directory request if it is listed in DirectoryIndex; bare Apache's
 * built-in default is "index.html" only, so relying on the host default silently
 * breaks setup on many shared hosts (the directory 403s / lists files instead).
 *
 * This asserts the directive at the source level. It cannot exercise real Apache
 * (the test stack runs `php -S`, which ignores .htaccess entirely and serves the
 * root via router.php), so this guards against the directive being dropped —
 * end-to-end HTTP verification requires a real Apache + mod_dir/mod_php.
