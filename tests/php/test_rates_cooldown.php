/**
 * ExchangeRates provider cooldown + fallback behavior (network-free, via the
 * ExchangeRates::$testProviders seam):
 *   - a throwing provider (transport failure / malformed body) earns an
 *     EndpointHealth cooldown and the next provider is used;
 *   - while cooling down, the failed provider is not called at all;
 *   - a null return (currency unsupported) does NOT earn a cooldown;
 *   - an insane (non-positive) rate earns a cooldown and falls through;
 *   - when EVERY provider is cooling down, cached data (stale, then last-good)
 *     is served immediately without touching the network — this is what keeps
 *     checkout fast during a full rates outage;
 *   - but with no cached data at all, cooled-down providers are still tried
 *     (pricing an invoice off a possible success beats guaranteed failure).
